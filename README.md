# silk site prototypes
### site prototypes for the Silk Web Toolkit

Site prototypes are scaffolding or templates to help get you started quickly with site building.
Build whatever templates help you out, complement the limited core templates bundled with Silk.

## how to build a site prototype

* have a look at the handful of samples under com/bheap/silk
* find or create a package directory to place your site prototype in
* name your prototype something sensible
  * 'default-empty' is the simplest possible site prototype, it simply creates a skeleton directory structure
  * 'default-basic' provides the simplest example with some css, one view, a template and a static component
* create all the required directories; .dna, component, meta, resource, site, template, view
