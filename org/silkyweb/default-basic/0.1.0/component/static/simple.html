      <p>This is just a simple static component!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Components allow you to easily reuse complex HTML over your site.</li>
        <li>This component just has a list inside it but it could easily be something much better.</li>
        <li>For example, a picture of a unicorn engaged in a battle to the death with the <a href="#">armies of darkness</a>.</li>
